# fluxmigrate
Tool to help migrate from the TYPO3 extension Flux to a solution closer to core

# Goals about the tool
- should make it easier and less time consuming to migrate away from EXT:flux and EXT:vhs
- should analyze existing structures to both migrate data and the content element definitions
- not necessarily the goal to make an A-Z tool where no manual work is required at all
